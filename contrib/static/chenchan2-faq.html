      <div class="head"><b>nntpchan FAQ:</b><br>What is nntpchan?</div>
      <div class="body">
        NNTPCchan is a federated imageboard that spans across several networks including tor, i2p and anonet. There are no central servers so that as long as 1 server is left the forum will continue to function.

      <div class="head">How is this different from *chan?</div>
      <div class="body">
        NNTPChan is by design invulnerable to global censorship. All moderation is local to each server.

      <div class="head">How does moderation work then?</div>
      <div class="body">
        Moderation is done with our special tripcodes (ed25519-sha512 signed posts). Anyone can give moderation suggestions, but that doesn't mean anyone will accept them. Those who trust the actions of a moderator can have their frontend whitelist the moderation actions and have them performed without oversight by another moderator.

      <div class="head">How can I remove content from nntpchan completely?</div>
      <div class="body">
        ‾\(._.)/‾ I don't know. You probably can't unless every server agrees to remove the content, even then, nothing prevents someone from reposting it. You can't delete what you post on the internet.

        If it violates USA Law or causes problems with my host, no. Otherwise, probably.

        That is not my problem. All posts on this site are the responsibility of the individual poster and not the administration of this server.
